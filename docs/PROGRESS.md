## Current Phase
Phase 0 — Foundation

## Current Sprint
Sprint 0 — Project Initialization (COMPLETED)

## Overall Status
IN PROGRESS

## Completed
- [x] Product concept defined
- [x] Core philosophy defined: Plan → Do → Record → Analyze → Improve
- [x] PRD drafted
- [x] Architecture drafted
- [x] Database design drafted
- [x] UI/UX direction drafted
- [x] Roadmap drafted
- [x] AI-agent rules defined

## Sprint 0 Checklist
- [x] Verify Flutter/Dart installation
- [x] Initialize Flutter application
- [x] Initialize/verify Git repository
- [x] Connect/verify GitHub repository
- [x] Create feature-based project structure
- [x] Configure Riverpod
- [x] Configure GoRouter
- [x] Establish SQLite/database foundation (drift + drift_flutter + build_runner code generation)
- [x] Establish theme/design tokens
- [x] Create reusable UI components foundation
- [x] Create basic Dashboard/Today screen
- [x] Create navigation shell
- [x] Create test structure
- [x] Run formatter (dart format passes, 0 changes)
- [x] Run analyzer (dart analyze lib/ passes with no issues)
- [x] Run tests (flutter test passes: +4: All tests passed!)
- [x] Run build check (build_runner generates successfully)
- [x] Review implementation against project docs
- [x] Create stable Git commit
- [x] Create automation/orchestrator infrastructure
- [x] Create AI documentation (workflow, decision policy, review, reporting)
- [x] Validate all automation scripts

## Automation & Orchestration
- `automation/config/workflow.yaml` — Workflow config with max_retries: 3, stop conditions, safety limits
- `automation/scripts/run-task.ps1` — Main orchestrator (`Invoke-Orchestrator`)
- `automation/scripts/validate.ps1` — Validation script with retry
- `automation/scripts/checkpoint.ps1` — State management, reports, resume
- `automation/prompts/developer.md` — OpenCode implementation prompt template
- `automation/prompts/reviewer.md` — Review prompt template
- `automation/prompts/decision.md` — Human decision escalation prompt template
- `automation/state/checkpoint.json` — State persistence (empty, ready for runtime)
- OpenCode available at `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\npm\opencode.ps1`

## Verification Results
- `dart analyze lib/`: No issues found
- `dart format --output=none .`: 0 changes
- `flutter test`: +4: All tests passed
- `flutter analyze`: No issues found
- `build_runner`: 38 outputs generated successfully
- `dart compile kernel`: Requires Flutter Dart SDK (dart:ui unavailable on Dart VM — expected)
- `dart test`: Includes Flutter framework files (SDK compatibility issue, not code-level)

## Current Task
Sprint 0 complete. Ready for Sprint 1.

## Next Task
Sprint 1: Implement Dashboard/Today screen logic with actual data from drift database.

## Known Issues / Decisions Pending
- Flutter SDK has compatibility issues with Dart SDK 3.13.2 causing `dart test` to include framework errors (framework-level, not code-level). `flutter test` passes with +4: All tests passed!
- `dart compile kernel` requires Flutter Dart SDK (dart:ui not available on standalone Dart VM — expected behavior)
- Database recurrence strategy should be finalized before implementing recurring schedule logic.
- Activity generation/occurrence strategy should be finalized before implementing schedule-to-activity behavior.
- Supabase/cloud sync is intentionally deferred.
- AI features are intentionally deferred.

## Recovery Instructions
If an agent/session stops unexpectedly:
1. Read this file.
2. Run `git status`.
3. Inspect the current diff and relevant files.
4. Continue the first incomplete checklist item.
5. Update this file after meaningful progress.
6. Commit only when the increment is stable.

## Last Updated
2026-09-07 (Automation infrastructure added, verification passed)
